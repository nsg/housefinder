# House Finder

So there are two larger sites that publishes houses here in Sweden. This do of course not cover the real estate agents internal lists, but this should cover most of the objects in the market.

## Booli API

Registrations for new accounts are closed, so I used BeautifulSoup to scrape the sites HTML. This will probably break whenever they update the site. This is just a short lived project for my own needs to this is fine ...

## Hemnet API

Only available for brokers, so I took the BeautifulSoup route here as well.

## Design

Quick and dirty, not generalized and written for my specific needs. If you need something similar feel free to use my code, it's licensed under MIT.
